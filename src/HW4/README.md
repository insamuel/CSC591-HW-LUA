For the interview and testing process of our tool, we decided to ask people about their favorite games for the Nintendo Switch.

The first person we interviewed mentioned these ten games:

1. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
2. Splatoon 3
3. Splatoon 2
4. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
5. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
6. Fire Emblem: Three Houses
7. Nintendo Switch Sports
8. Mario Party Superstars
9. Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu!/Eevee!
10. Animal Crossing: New Horizons

Each following interviewee were asked about the same ten games. However, the attributes used to describe them were left to the individual to come up with. 

The results of each interview can be found [here](https://github.com/insamuel/CSC591-HW-LUA/tree/hw4_writeup/etc/out/hw4_interview_output).

Some of the common types of attributes selected by the interviewees to describe these games were:

- Adjectives that described how polished/free of bugs a game was.
- A game’s look or feel.
- The perceived quality of a game’s story and/or characters.

In each interview’s reprows results, games (examples) that had similar attribute ratings were grouped together. For example, in 2/3 of our results, Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3 were clustered together since the interviewees rated them similarly. 


Attributes that were similar were also generally grouped together in each set of results (repcols results). For example, the “Buggy-ness” attribute of a game was grouped with the “Good graphics vs. Bad graphics” or “Unresponsive vs Responsive controls” attributes.
